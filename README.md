## Overview

Deep Thinker is a high-performance toolkit for Reinforcement Learning ðŸš€

* Tired of running your Reinforcement Learning algorithms on one thread? Deep Thinker can utilize your machine's total processing power and scale to many machines.
* Is your RL environment written in something other than Python? If so, then Deep Thinker is for you. Easily connect to Deep Thinker using any language or protocol.

Some example configurations:

Deep Thinker is currently in early development. The API is not stable and will change frequently. For a simple example, check out https://github.com/jt70/deep_thinker/tree/main/cartpole_dqn.

## Coming soon

* Connect with GRPC
* GRPC example
* Implement PPO
