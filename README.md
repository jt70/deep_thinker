## Overview

Deep Thinker is a ubiquitous, high-performance toolkit for Reinforcement Learning ðŸš€

* Deep Thinker will support RL environments written in any almost any language including C++, JVM (Java, Kotlin, Scala, etc.), C#, F#, Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, PHP, Rust, Swift, Haskell. Basically, any language that supports ZeroMQ and Flatbuffers. 
* Develop clustered Reinforcement learning algorithms using Vert.x clustering.

Deep Thinker is currently in early development. The API is not stable and will change frequently. For a simple example, check out https://github.com/jt70/deep_thinker/tree/main/cartpole_dqn.

## Coming soon

* C# client / examples
* Performance improvements
* Implement PPO
